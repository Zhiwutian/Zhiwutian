## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ˜„ About Me:

My name is Brett Albright.

As a current senior software engineer at Silicon Based Solutions and part-time web development instructor at Learningfuze with over six years of experience, I not only have the privilege of developing and providing technical oversight on professional full stack applications used by clients all over the United States, but I also am able to mentor hundreds of web development students as they work to start a career in software engineering. My technical expertise spans multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, PHP, Python, Java, C++, and Go, as well as various SQL and NoSQL databases.

One of the most rewarding aspects of my career is the continuous opportunity to engage with new technologies. I thrive on learning alongside my colleagues and students, embracing both educational and programming challenges to deepen my knowledge and expertise.

I am passionate about leading project teams and guiding new programmers to transform their ideas into functional applications. The collaborative nature of software development allows me to interact with diverse teams and explore multiple approaches to project organization and execution.

Currently, my focus is on leading my dev teams in the planning and implementing two new projects for our client Hyundai USA. One which will allow users to Build and Search through vehicle inventory nationally through a network of over 800 dealers, and another to allow users to setup lease agreements for EV vehicles at the click of a button.

My ultimate goal is to maintain a lifelong commitment to learning and to seize opportunities that allow me to tackle new challenges, delivering exceptional products for my clients.
