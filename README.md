## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ˜„ About Me:

My name is Brett Albright.

As a seasoned software engineer and web development instructor with six years of experience, I have had the privilege of mentoring hundreds of web development students and contributing to a variety of dynamic applications. My technical expertise spans multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, PHP, Python, Java, C++, as well as various SQL and NoSQL databases.

One of the most rewarding aspects of my career is the continuous opportunity to engage with new technologies. I thrive on learning alongside my students, embracing both educational and programming challenges to deepen my knowledge and expertise.

I am passionate about leading project teams and guiding new programmers to transform their ideas into functional applications. The collaborative nature of software development allows me to interact with diverse teams and explore multiple approaches to project organization and execution.

Currently, my focus is on DevOps and deployments, where I am immersing myself in the intricacies of cloud hosting services such as AWS, Heroku, Digital Ocean, Azure, and Glitch. Managing servers and ensuring applications perform reliably in real-world conditions is an exhilarating challenge that I thoroughly enjoy.

My ultimate goal is to maintain a lifelong commitment to learning and to seize opportunities that allow me to tackle new challenges, delivering exceptional products for my clients.
